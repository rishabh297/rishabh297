## ðŸ”¬ Postgrad Projects:
1. **Neural ODEs for Pharmacokinetics (PK) Modeling:** Implemented a neural network model for state-of-the-art PK Modeling
2. **Multi-omics Data Analysis Pipeline:** Developed a pipeline to analyze next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiment data
3. **Bioinformatics Target Identification Tool:** Built a bioinformatics tool to analyze genomics data from Single cell and Bulk RNA sequencing
4. **Early Detection of ARDS Subphenotypes Using ML:** Designed an ML Model to accurately detect ARDS subphenotypes at baseline

## ðŸŽ“ Business Projects:
1. **Hate Speech Analysis:** Developed interval variables via faceted Rasch measurement and multitask deep learning to understand hate speech dynamics.
2. **Causal Inference of Chemical Exposures:** Devised a targeted learning method for the causal inference of multiple treatment exposures to chemicals.
3. **Heart Attack Risk Prediction:** Constructed a nested ensemble clinical model to predict heart attack risk from electronic health records.

## ðŸ”­ Additional Projects:
1. **Molecular Cell Atlas of the Human Lung:** Conducted analysis of Single-cell gene expression data of 116,314 cells from 20 frozen lungs
2. **Biomarkers for Kidney Antibody-mediated Rejection (ABMR):** Identified key genes and pathways associated with ABMR using Bulkm RNA-Seq Data

I'm always looking for ways to drive innovation through data. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on your next project.
