## ðŸ”¬ Postgrad Projects:
1. **Neural ODEs for Pharmacokinetics (PK) Modeling:** Implemented a neural network model to improve state-of-the-art PK Modeling
2. **Multi-omics Data Analysis Pipeline:** Developed a data pipeline to analyze data from next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments
3. **Bioinformatics Target Identification Tool:** Built a bioinformatics tool to analyze genomics data from Sc/Bulk RNA sequencing

## ðŸŽ“ Business Projects:
1. **Hate Speech Analysis:** Developed interval variables via faceted Rasch measurement and multitask deep learning to understand hate speech dynamics.
2. **Causal Inference of Chemical Exposures:** Devised a targeted learning method for the causal inference of multiple treatment exposures to chemicals.
3. **Heart Attack Risk Prediction:** Constructed a nested ensemble clinical model to predict heart attack risk from electronic health records.

## ðŸ”­ Additional Projects:
1. **Molecular Cell Atlas of the Human Lung:** Utilized multi-modal deep learning to track social media marketing of e-cigarettes (vaping) targeted at teenagers.
2. **Biomarkers for Kidney Antibody-mediated Rejection (ABMR):** Developed a causally-motivated, nonparametric software to gauge variable importance.

I'm always looking for ways to drive innovation through data. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on your next project.
