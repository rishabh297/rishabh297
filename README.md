### Hello there, I'm Rishabh ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist and computational biologist, with a strong academic background in Molecular and Cell Biology and Data Science from the University of California, Berkeley. I have a proven industry experience of 3+ years in leveraging  machine learning techniques, multi-omics data analysis, and state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to drive innovative data-driven solutions.


## ðŸ”¬ Postdoc Projects:
1. **Reducing Opioid Overprescription:** Implemented prescription guidelines and provider interventions to measure and mitigate the overconsumption of opioids post-surgery.
2. **Surgical Skill & Risk Assessment:** Used deep learning to analyze surgical videos and operative notes to assess surgical skill and complication risk.
3. **COVID-19 Severity Measurement:** Employed Item Response Theory and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to measure COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients.

## ðŸŽ“ Dissertation Projects:
1. **Hate Speech Analysis:** Developed interval variables via faceted Rasch measurement and multitask deep learning to understand hate speech dynamics.
2. **Causal Inference of Chemical Exposures:** Devised a targeted learning method for the causal inference of multiple treatment exposures to chemicals.
3. **Heart Attack Risk Prediction:** Constructed a nested ensemble clinical model to predict heart attack risk from electronic health records.

## ðŸ”­ Long-term Projects:
1. **E-cigarette Marketing Study:** Utilized multi-modal deep learning to track social media marketing of e-cigarettes (vaping) targeted at teenagers.
2. **VarImpact Software:** Developed a causally-motivated, nonparametric software to gauge variable importance.

I'm always looking for ways to drive innovation through data. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on your next project.
